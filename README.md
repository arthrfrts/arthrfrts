# Hello! I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer, and for over ten years I've been making better websites for nice people around the world.

During this time, I've worked with a bunch of web technologies. PHP, SQL, React, Svelte, Vue, TypeScript, Ruby... Systems like WordPress, WooCommerce, Drupal, Shopify, and NextJS too.

My true mother tongue is **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. With these, it seems like I can do anything. From mere documents to real web experiences that anyone with access to a browser can enjoy. That's my favorite magic.

I also make [small web games][1] and [write on my blog][2].

You can reach me at <email@arthr.me>.

Thank you!
