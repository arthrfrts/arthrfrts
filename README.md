### ðŸ‘‹ Well, hello!

I'm Arthur, I make lovely handcrafted experiences on the web for nice people around the world.

I have extensive knowledge in web technologies and its ecosystem. I make sites with semantic, valid, and modern HTML snd CSS, considering accessibility from the start. I also create and mantain projects with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), and develop web applications with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

On my free time I enjoy watching movies, [blogging about them](https://paomortadela.com.br) and making [small web games](https://arthr.me/jogos/)

You can find me at <email@arthr.me> or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arthrfrts), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthrfrts) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/arthrfrts). Check out my latest client work on [arthr.me](https://arthr.me/).
