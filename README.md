### ðŸ‘‹ Well, hello!

I'm Arthur, I make lovely handcrafted experiences on the web for nice people around the world.

I have extensive knowledge in web technologies and the web ecosystem. I make sites with semantic, valid, and modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript â€” considering accessibility from the start. I also create and mantain projects with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), help clients with systems from [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) to [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) and [Shopify](https://shopify.com), and develop web applications with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React + Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

I also enjoy gardening and making [small web games](https://irrelefante.com.br/).

You can find me at <email@arthr.dev> or on [my blog](https://irrelefante.com.br), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/arthrfrts), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthrfrts) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/arthrfrts).
